## Szczegółowy opis

The Thimble Museum, also called Fingerhutmuseum in Germany where it is located, holds a large collection of a small tools designed to protect delicate fingers from sewing needles. This unique collection houses more than 4,000 thimbles from around the world.

These thimbles span a bewildering array of styles, from jewel-encrusted thimbles adorned with intricate miniature sculptures to strictly utilitarian tools. There are very, very old thimbles, such as mammoth bone and stone precursors to the modern thimble, as well as modern-day thimbles like a Micheal Jackson memorial thimble.

There are thimbles made from almost any material you could imagine: leather, gold, embroidered silk, animal bone, glass, ceramic, ivory, stone, and more. Who knew there was so much to know about thimbles?
