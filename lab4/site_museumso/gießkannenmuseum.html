                    <p>
                        Over 1,000 watering cans in every imaginable style are on display in a free museum atop a
                        German mall.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <span class="text-green-400">"Giesskannenmuseum"</span> (Watering Can Museum) in Giessen
                        celebrates the common watering can—be it
                        antiquarian, modern, valuable or cheap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The museum opened in 2011, funded by the City of Giessen and run by the Gaertnerpflichten artist
                        group (Oliver Behnecke, Ingke Guenther, Esther Steinbrecher and Joerg Wagner). The location of
                        the museum is no coincidence: the name Giessen means "to water". </p>
                    <p>
                        There are more cans being added each week. Most are donated, but some are purchased especially
                        for exhibition. Every can is cataloged, stories or memories from the former owners are collected
                        and every donation is registered.The large collection emphasizes the great variety in watering
                        cans. Though they all have a container, a spout, a shower piece and a handle, the cans vary in
                        design, material and quality. Pressed metal, plastic or ceramic, chic design object or banal
                        garden supply, for indoor or outdoor use, the watering can is a utilitarian object but also a
                        beautiful one.
                    </p>
                    <p>The museum has also acquired some beautiful prints from the late 19th century, where watering
                        cans can be seen in different contexts. A collection of 26 sheets can be seen in a specially
                        equipped display cabinet. On wood and copper, in engravings, lithographs and illustrations, the
                        watering can is sometimes shown as protagonist and sometimes as a mere accessory.</p>
                    <p>Since spring of 2012, the Giesskannenmuseum has cooperated with the Frankfurtart project
                        "Botanoadopt", by Haike Rausch and Torsten Grosch. Here "neglected and abused houseplants"
                        receive individual names and biographies and are presented in the Watering Can Museum for
                        adoption, but only into good hands.</p>
                    <p class="text-blue-400">Update May, 2018: The museum has moved and is now located at Sonnenstraße,
                        near the Botanical
                        Garden. It's visible from the street and can be found easily now.</p>
