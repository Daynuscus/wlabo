                        Bernhard Stellmacher has always been a collector. In his teenage years he amassed everything he
                        could find about Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. He was fascinated by her smile. However, his
                        interests shifted when he heard a report on the radio that stated "the banana is nature's
                        smile."
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="text-green-400">Since then, </span> as he puts it, he was infected with <span
                            class="text-red-400">"Bananicus." </span> He began collecting everything and anything banana
                        related. He began creating art under the name "Stelli Banana." Soon he had the idea for a
                        showcase of his artifacts, rebuilt the basement of his house, and opened the Banana Museum, or
                        "Erstes Deutsches Bananen Museum," "Germany's First Banana Museum."
                    </p>
                    <p>The basement museum is stuffed to the brim with bananas of all sorts, from a banal salt shaker in
                        form of a banana, to banana flavored condoms, to a train signal with a banana as pointer. The
                        museum's insight extends beyond the obvious, and features pop cultural items like Andy Warhol's
                        banana print and a corner dedicated to Josephine Baker's banana skirt. The most valuable exhibit
                        is an 18th century engraving by the natural scientist and artist Maria Sibylla Merian.
                    </p>
                    <p>Half an East German car bursts through the wall in an exhibition about the "Banana Boom" caused
                        by opening of the inner German border in 1989.Prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall, itwas hard
                        for East Germans to get produce, including bananas, which they could only get on Christmas if
                        they were lucky. When the border opened the East Germans came in droves to supermarkets in West
                        Germany to load theircarsfull of bananas, making it hard to get bananas in West Germany, and of
                        course, raising the banana prices. These fruit wars went on for some time.</p>
                    <p>Stellmacher ascribes Biblical roots to the humble banana. He claims, "Everybody thinks the apple
                        is the fruit of knowledge. But this is not written in the Bible. There it only says, '... and
                        Eve thought the fruit was cheerful to look at.' And a fruit cheerful to look at can only be the
                        banana."</p>
                    <p>Over the years Bernhard Stellmacher has collected more than 10,000 banana related artifacts. And
                        almost every day he receives parcels from all over the world from people wishing to contribute
                        to the museum. He once got a parcel fromThailandwith a coconut inside. Engraved on the husk was
                        the phrase: "I exclaim: I am a banana!" Stellmacher is always delighted and grateful to receive
                        new donations, particularly ones as happy as that.</p>
                    <p class="text--400">

                        Due to the expansiveness of Stellmacher's collection, banana exhibits are frequently swapped
                        out. This is why visitors return again and again, as there is always something new to admire.
                        Stellmacher reports that more than 75% of his visitors are women. He is unsurprised by this
                        statistic, as he believes women are naturally more curious. Men, in his view, are more
                        thin-skinned, particularly when it comes to phallic objects. They fear someone might poke fun at
                        them, and Bernhard Stellmacher likes to do just that.
